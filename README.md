#Sketch Pad
## A Project for Learning JavaScript/jQuery

This is an assignment from the free curriculum at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

I learned a lot from putting together this project. It really helped me see how HTML, CSS, and JS work together to create an experience for the user.

If you have questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. I'm always looking for new contacts and people to learn with!
